# Bellingcat - Bellingcat Globetrotters - A Sticky Situation - Write-up

This write-up covers the Bellingcat Globetrotters - A Sticky Situation puzzle by [Bellingcat](https://challenge.bellingcat.com/), a geolocation challenge requiring participants to determine the coordinates of a location depicted in an image. The puzzle was created by [Foeke Postma, Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/author/foekepostma/).

This guide provides a step-by-step solution to the challenge, offering insights and techniques useful for OSINT investigations. It’s recommended to attempt solving the challenge on your own first and then refer to this solution if you get stuck or want to verify your findings. Keep in mind that OSINT challenges often have multiple valid approaches; what matters most is your confidence and proficiency with the methods you choose.

## Task briefing

> The mountains look great from up here!

>
> But where was this enviable mountaineering adventure taking place?
>
> What is the name of the mountain on which Foeke was standing?

## Investigation

### Image analysis

Let's begin by examining the provided image. The picture shows a stunning mountainous landscape with rolling green hills in the foreground and towering peaks in the background. The valley below is dotted with settlements and farmland, indicating a well-inhabited area.

In the foreground, there is a wooden pole, which seems to be held by cables, on which is a metal box covered with stickers. Some of these stickers display logos and symbols related to outdoor activities, hiking, and possibly local organizations. One sticker features a QR code with the phrase "Ready4HikeMountain" and a website reference (mysprheadshop.at), which might indicate a connection to Austria. Several stickers also refer to Tyrol, which reinforces the idea that the mountain could be located in Austria, in the Tyrolean mountain region.

The perspective of the photo suggests it was taken from a high-altitude vantage point, possibly near the summit of a mountain. The presence of a metal box with stickers suggests that this might be a popular hiking destination where visitors leave their marks. To determine the exact mountain, further clues are needed, such as identifying the valley and peaks in the background, or what this wooden pole should be.

### Identifying the wooden pole

While searching for famous images of Austrian peaks, I realized that the wooden post is most likely a wooden cross. Indeed, summit crosses are Christian crosses placed on top of a mountain or hill, to mark its summit. Often, a summit register (Gipfelbuch) is placed on the cross, either in a container or other weatherproof case, hence the metal case in our image. Summit crosses are found mainly in the Catholic regions of the Alps.

Now let's look for a high wooden cross held by cables, with a metal box on which stickers are stuck, on a peak in Tyrol.
