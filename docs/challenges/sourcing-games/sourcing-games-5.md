# Sourcing Game 5 - SourceCon 2017

Here you can find the method and solutions to successfully pass [Sourcing Game 5](https://sourcing.games/game-5/) which will guide you through the basics of sourcing at an advanced level. This game was created for spring SourceCon 2017. Remember, there isn't just one solution; there are multiple ways to approach the games. The key is to be comfortable with the method you choose.

## Game 01 - Finding twice SourceCon GrandMaster

### Instructions

The first person to win GrandMaster challenge at SourceCon twice is something of a legend.
And the answer you are looking for is two years when that person achieves this title.

### Objective

The aim of Game 01 is to find out who is the first person to win the GrandMaster challenge at SourceCon twice and in which years.

### Solution

Simply Google the following query: `grandmaster challenge sourcecon` and choosed the `grandmaster` page of the [Sourcecon](https://www.sourcecon.com/grandmaster) site. It appears that Michael Notaro, the first winner of the GrandMaster challenge, won it in two successive years: 2007 and 2008.

## Game 02 - Exploring Twitter archives

### Instructions

Gary Vaynerchuk joined Twitter in 2007, and his first tweet has a number in this message.
And this number is your password for your new level.

### Objective

The goal of Game 02 is to find out the first post from 2007 by Gary Vaynerchuk on Twitter. Given the number of tweets posted by this account, it can be tedious to search manually.

### Solution

With [Twitter Advanced Search](https://www.morgane-gautier.com/master-twitter-advanced-search-operators), it's easy to find specific tweets using operators. These operators allow you to specify criteria like a date range, a person, a phrase, a geographic area, and more.

First, find Gary Vaynerchuk's Twitter account. His handle is @garyvee, and his account was created in May 2007, which likely corresponds to the date of his first tweet.

Here we will search through tweets from a particular Twitter account using the `from:` operator, and limit our searches by specific dates with the `since:` and `until:` operators. This gives us the following query to enter in the Twitter Advanced Search bar:

`from:garyvee since:2007-05-01 until:2007-05-31`

Select the "latest" tab to see each tweet posted in chronological order. Find the first tweet among this selection.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

## Game 04 - Find a LinkedIn profile

### Instructions

I am looking for the surname of a person living in Canada in the largest city in the Québec province. That person worked for Midiaweb as a Strategic Planner Coordinator. Can you find the surname of that person?

### Objective

The aim of Game 04 is to find the name of a person, given some information. Here we have 3 useful pieces of information about the person:
 - Location: Canada, Québec province
 - Occupation: Strategic Planner Coordinator
 - Employer: Midiaweb

### Solution

The simplest way to find the person's name is to find their LinkedIn profile if they have one. Let's use Google dorking. In your search query, enter your keywords and add `site:linkedin.com` to limit the search results to LinkedIn only:

`Québec Midiaweb Strategic Planner Coordinator site:linkedin.com`

Here is the search result:

## Game 05 - Find a LinkedIn profile

`CIO Motorola Basel site:linkedin.com`

We get a shortlist of LinkedIn profiles to test.
