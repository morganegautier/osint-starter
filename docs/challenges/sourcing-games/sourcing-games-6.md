# Sourcing Game 6 - AirSource One

Here you can find the method and solutions to successfully pass [Sourcing game 6](https://sourcing.games/game-6/) which will guide you through the basics of sourcing at an advanced level. This game was created for spring AirSource One in 2017. Remember, there isn't just one solution; there are multiple ways to approach the games. The key is to be comfortable with the method you choose.

## Game 01 - Exploring Wikipedia

### Instructions

What year did the world’s first recruitment agency start?

### Objective

The aim of Game 01 is to find the year when the world’s first recruitment agency was created.

### Solution

Let's Google the following query: `world’s first recruitment agency`. It gives us plenty of results, many referencing the first known private employment agency. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_agency) about employment agencies tells this story in detail with a reliable source.

## Game 02 - Find the sourcer with a hat

### Instructions

The radio show is about sourcing and about other sourcers, so let’s find out how good you know people from sourcing. What is the surname of the person (he/she) who never wears a suit, but he/she will always wear a hat?

### Objective

The goal of Game 02 is to identify the sourcer who is known for never wearing a suit but always wearing a hat.

### Solution

I tried Googling the phrase `never wear suit always wear hat`, but didn't get any conclusive results. However, since the person we're looking for is a sourcer, the phrase sounds like a distinct characteristic within the sourcing community. Searching for this on LinkedIn brought up the name Bill Boorman, a well-known figure in the sourcing world who is often seen with a hat and without a suit.

Some graphic designers are talented, but they don’t want to reveal their names. But can you find the first name of this graphic designer? He is using a few variants of his name but you need to find the one that has five letters.

### Objective

The goal of Game 03 is to find the five-letter first name of the graphic designer known as "chubasan."

### Solution

By Googling `chubasan`, you will come across several mentions of his real name.

## Game 04 - Finding information in an old article

### Instructions

Katrina Collier is very active person, and some time ago, she had an interview for AOL at London about “Why job hunters…”. In the penultimate paragraph of that article, there is one number showing how many people are without work at Streatham, and this number is the answer for your next level.

### Objective

The goal of Game 04 is to find the number of unemployed people in Streatham from an article about job hunters featuring Katrina Collier.

### Solution

I began by searching for the article on the AOL website but couldn't find anything directly. Then I used Google dorking with the query `Katrina Collier job hunters "Streatham"`, which led me to an article titled "Why job hunters should give the Jobcentre a miss" by Reena Sewraz on the website [Love Money](https://www.lovemoney.com/news/15321/you-cant-get-a-job-at-the-jobcentre). Although this wasn't directly from AOL, the article contains the interview with Katrina Collier.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:
