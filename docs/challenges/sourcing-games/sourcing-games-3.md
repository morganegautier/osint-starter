# Sourcing Game 3 - In sourcing, you need to be creative on how to find data

Here you can find the method and solutions to successfully pass [Sourcing Game 3](https://sourcing.games/game-3/) which will guide you through the basics of sourcing at an advanced level. Remember, there isn't just one solution; there are multiple ways to approach the games. The key is to be comfortable with the method you choose.

## Game 01 - Exploring URLs

### Instructions

Get the password from the URL below.

[OPEN URL](http://g3.inovace.eu/start.html)

### Objective

The aim of Game 01 is to find a password that unlocks the next level. To do this, click on the "OPEN SITE" button, which will redirect you to a new page called "start.html". On the new page, you will see the following message: "Every now and then folders will show the files you are looking for. Protection is important!."

### Solution

Let's visit the website's homepage, which seems to be a folder containing three files: resume.docx, resume.pdf, and start.html. Open one of the resume files and you will find the password.

## Game 02 - Binary decoding

### Instructions

Sometimes, you need to decode messages that people are sharing on their profile. Because you can use that info in the message that you are going to send them.

01010000 01100001 01110011 01110011 01110111 01101111 01110010 01100100 00100000 01101001 01110011 00111010 00100000 01110011 01110100 01100001 01100011 01101011 00110001 00110100

### Objective

The goal of Game 02 is to decode a binary message which gives you the password to unlock the level.

### Solution

To decode the binary message, you can use a binary converter like [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html). On the tool, choose a conversion from binary to text and paste your binary code. The conversion will give you the password.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

## Game 03 - Exploring StackOverflow

### Instructions

Finding some answers is easy; for instance, the name of the highest reputation holder on Stackoverflow. The company name where this person worked in 2020 is your password for the next level.

### Objective

The aim of Game 03 is to find the user with the highest reputation on StackOverflow and identify the company he was working for in 2020.

### Solution

Go to the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) website and click on "Users" in the left sidebar. This section lists the top contributors on Stack Overflow. Then filter the list by "reputation" and select "all" to see the users with the highest reputation overall.

![StackOverflow](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-3/sourcing-games-3-03-1.png "StackOverflow")

The highest reputation holder on Stack Overflow is Jon Skeet. To find the company Jon Skeet was working for in 2020, perform a Google search for Jon Skeet's LinkedIn profile using the following query:

```Jon Skeet site:linkedin.com```

Select the link to Jon Skeet's LinkedIn profile to find detailed information about his employment history:

## Game 05 - Exploring Twitter acrhives

### Instructions

Sometime in May 2019, José invited someone to prom, and Chase covered this story. What was the name of the person that José invited?

### Objective

The aim of Game 05 is to find an old post from May 2019 from @Chase on Twitter. Given the number of tweets posted by this account, it can be tedious to search manually.

### Solution

With Twitter Advanced Search, it's easy to find specific tweets using operators. These operators allow you to specify criteria like a date range, a person, a phrase, a geographic area, and more.

Here we will search through tweets from a particular Twitter account using the `from:` operator, and limit our searches by specific dates with the `since:` and `until:` operators. This gives us the following query to enter in the Twitter Advanced Search bar:

`from:Chase since:2019-04-30 until:2019-06-01`

All you have to do next is find the Tweet you are looking for among this selection.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

<details>
<summary>Solution to game 05</summary>

![Solution to game 05](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-3/sourcing-games-3-05.png "Solution to game 05")

The password to reach the next level is "**Destiny**".

## Game 06 - Find a username

### Instructions

Meeting new people is always great because you will learn a lot about them and also from them. My friend met a guy in California who is working there as a data scientist, and he told him that he is a discussion master on the site that has something to do with “Your Home for Data Science.”

He remembered his profile photo on his page on that website (not LinkedIn), where he was wearing glasses and a funny winter hat.
What is his username on LinkedIn?

### Objective

The goal of Game 06 is to find a person's LinkedIn username based on their location, job, status, and some details about their profile picture on a site whose name we need to find.

### Solution

First, we need to find the name of the website, knowing that it has something to do with "Your Home for Data Science". Let's search for this clue on Google. Two websites seem to fit this description: Towards Data Science and Kaggle. After spending some time searching, I couldn't find anything matching the description of the person I was looking for on Towards Data Science, so I turned to Kaggle. Let's use Google dorking with the given information, using the following query:

`california data scientist discussion master site:kaggle.com`

We get a list of profiles that we will sift through:

![Solution to game 06](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-3/sourcing-games-3-06-1.png "Solution to game 06")

Luckily, the first profile seems to match the description given: a Californian data scientist wearing glasses and a funny winter hat.

![Solution to game 06](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-3/sourcing-games-3-06-2.png "Solution to game 06")

All that remains is to search for the person's LinkedIn profile in order to confirm their username using the following search: `Branden Murray site:linkedin.com,` and look for "Branden Murray" LinkedIn profiles.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

<details>
<summary>Solution to game 06</summary>

![Solution to game 06](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-3/sourcing-games-3-06-3.png "Solution to game 06")

The password to reach the next level is "**brandenkmurray**".
