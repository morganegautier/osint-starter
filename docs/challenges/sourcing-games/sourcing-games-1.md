# Sourcing Games 1 - Beginning with the basics

Here you can find the method and solutions to successfully pass [Sourcing games 1](https://sourcing.games/game-1/) which will guide you through the basics of sourcing.  Remember, there isn't just one solution; there are multiple ways to approach the games. The key is to be comfortable with the method you choose.

## Game 01 - Use inspection tool

### Instructions

Password from that page below will unlock next level. [OPEN SITE](http://inovace.eu/game01/)

### Objective

The aim of Game 01 is to find a password that unlocks the next level. To do this, click on the "OPEN SITE" button, which will redirect you to a new page.
On the new page, you will see a blank screen with the message, "78% SOURCERS ARE NOT GOING TO PASS THIS FIRST LEVEL." This isn't very helpful on its own. 

### Solution

To find a hint, try selecting all the elements on the page. You'll then see a new message: "NOT ALL THINGS THAT ARE INVISIBLE ARE HIDDEN." This indicates that the hint is hidden on the page.

Use the inspection tool on this hint. You'll find the password commented within the page's code, which will take you to the next level.

## Game 03 - Explore metadata of a shortened URL

Find the date when this [URL](https://bit.ly/mylnkbio) (shortener) was created. Password is Month and Day (eg. “jan” and day “1”).

### Objective

The aim of Game 03 is to find the date when a shortened URL was created.

Here, the URL shortening service is Bitly, so the simplest method to track it is to add a "+" to the shortened link.

## Game 04 - Find the email address of a person, given name and organization

### Instructions

I met James Jones a few years ago, and he helped me with some things at recruitment.camp. To speed up our communication, I gave him an email at recruitment.camp. However, I had to learn how to create a professional email address, especially since James didn’t want to have a dot in the email address. His email is the password to the file below (Download file).

Hint: Don’t let bounce, disposable, spam-trap and deactivated emails decrease your sending reputation.

### Objective

The goal of Game 04 is to find the email address of a person, given their first name, last name, and organization (or domain). 

### Solution

Many combinations are possible, and testing them all could take a long time. Here’s the method to streamline the process:

1. Use an email permutator like '[mailmeteor](https://mailmeteor.com/email-permutator/)' to generate a list of all possible email combinations.
2. Pass this list through an email checker like '[deltadromeus](https://www.deltadromeus.com/)' to eliminate all bounce, disposable, spam-trap, and deactivated emails.

If all goes well, you will be left with one valid email address. Download the file using the valid email address as the password.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

![Solution to game 04](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-1/sourcing-games-1-04-2.png "Solution to game 04")

The correct mail adress and file password is "**jamesj@recruitment.camp**".

The password to reach the next level is "**sourcingfun**".

## Game 05 - Find the name of a person from a user profile

### Instructions

Find the first name of this [StackOverflow](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/5696502/arsen) user.

### Objective

The aim of Game 05 is to find the name of a person from a user profile. When clicking on the given link, you will arrive at a StackOverflow profile, which fortunately includes a profile photo and several linkks to other social media accounts. This will make the search easier. 

### Solution

Use your search engine's reverse image search function, such as "Search images with Google". You will find several other accounts using this profile photo, such as GitHub and X (formerly Twitter), with a similar username and, most importantly, the name of the person in the profile picture.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

<summary>Solution to game 05</summary>

The password to reach the next level is "**Kolja**".

## Game 06 - Find a webpage that has been indexed

### Instructions

One folder of this website “inovace.eu” was indexed by Google. You can find there the password for the next level.

### Objective

The goal of Game 06 is to find a page on a given URL that has been indexed. The URL is "inovace.eu." When you visit this site, you'll see it currently displays only "Under Construction..." with no links to other pages. 

### Solution

To learn more about the site's structure over time, you can use the Wayback Machine tool, particularly the [Site Map section](https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/). This feature organizes website archives by year and creates a visual site map as a radial-tree graph. The center circle represents the website's root, with successive rings indicating site pages. Hovering over the rings shows corresponding URLs at the top, and clicking on any page directs you to its archive.

By entering the given URL in the search bar and exploring different years, you will find that in a certain year, the site offered different pages, including a "folder" page that still exists by the way and contains the desired password.

By expanding the solution section below, you will see the password:

<details>
<summary>Solution to game 06</summary>

![Solution to game 06](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-1/sourcing-games-1-06.png "Solution to game 06")

The password to reach the next level is "**007games**".
