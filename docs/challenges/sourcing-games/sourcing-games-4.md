# Sourcing Games 4 - Try and fail, but never fail to try

Here you can find the method and solutions to successfully pass [Sourcing Games 4](https://sourcing.games/game-4/) which will guide you through the basics of sourcing at an advanced level. Remember, there isn't just one solution; there are multiple ways to approach the games. The key is to be comfortable with the method you choose.

## Game 01 - Finding who Boolean is

### Instructions

Some people are saying that Boolean died during 2014 ‚Äì 2017. But I am sure that he died in some other year. When?

### Objective

The aim of Game 01 is to find out who or what "Boolean" is in order to determine when he died.

### Solution

First, let's identify who `Boolean` refers to. A quick search for Boolean death leads to results about George Boole. George Boole is known as the creator of modern logic based on an algebraic and semantic structure, commonly known as Boolean algebra.

To find out the year of his death, let's refer to his Wikipedia page or other reliable sources.

George Boole died in 1864.

## Game 03 - Finding a PDF file

### Instructions

I saw a PDF file about advanced Boolean and some search tips on a website. I can‚Äôt recall the website but I am pretty sure it was related to site academia.edu.
The author was from some university, perhaps California or Florida, but I am not sure.
You will find the answer in the file and his surname on the bottom of that file is your password to the next level.

### Objective

The aim of Game 03 is to find the surname of the author from some university of a PDF file about advanced Boolean and some search tips, published on a website related to academia.edu.

### Solution

First I searched for the pdf on the site "academia.edu", but that didn't give anything. The search description is pretty vague, but the reliable information includes the topic, the fact that the author is an academic, and that the file is a PDF. Using Google, I performed a search with the following query: `advanced boolean search tips university filetype:PDF`, where `filetype:` allows you to specify the type of file, in this case, a PDF.

The results obtained are as follows:

![PDF](/img/challenges/sourcing-games/game-2/sourcing-games-4-03-1.png "PDF")

The first PDF returned comes from the ResearchGate site and seems to match the description given. It is entitled "Basic Search Tips and Advanced Boolean Explained" and has been created by Joe Barker, Teaching Library, University of California, Berkeley.

The search results point to Dr. Margaret Z. Jones, M.D. Various sites confirm the given information: on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Margaret-Jones-8), we learn that Margaret was indeed a professor at Michigan State University from January 1970 to July 2000, totaling 30 years of service. On [curekirby.org](https://curekirby.org/research-2/michigan-state-university/) we see that Margaret published work on SanFilippo Syndrome.

With Margaret's identity confirmed, we need to find her year of birth. The [Michigan State University archives](https://archive.lib.msu.edu/uahc/FindingAids/ua17-144.html) dedicate a page to her, including a biography that contains her date of birth.
